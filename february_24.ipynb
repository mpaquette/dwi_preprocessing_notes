    "\n",
    "This signal on the sphere can be transformed into a **diffusion orientation distribution function (dODF)**, typically represented as a deformed sphere which represent the \"amount of diffusion\" at all orientations.  \n",

    "- There is more diffusion along the orientation of WM bundles then across because it is easier (less obstacles) for water molecule to move in that directions.  \n",
    "- Therefore, the maximas of the dODF should match bundle orienation.  \n",
    "- However, there is still some diffusion in other orientations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we want to create a **fiber orientation distribution function (fODF or FOD)** which is an object representing the \"probabilities\" or \"proportion\" of fiber at all orientation instead.  \n",

    "The most common choice is lmax=8 (or sh order 8) but this requires 45+ bvecs to be well defined (i.e. the SH basis of order maximum 8 has 45 degree-of-freedom).  \n",
