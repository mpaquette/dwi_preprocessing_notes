    "\n",
    "We have already used it before for a few simple case:  \n",

    "\n",
    "mrcalc can be used to chain together multiple operation.  \n",
    "It uses what is called a stack, it reads in inputs and put them one by one \"on-top\" of each other, then, when we use an operation flag such as '-mul', it takes image from the top of the stack until is gets enough for the operation, it compute the operation and put the result on top of the stack.  \n",
    "For exemple, if you want to multiply 3 images together you could use the command  \n",
    "`mrcalc A B C -mul -mul output`  \n",
    "It reads from left to right the images, creating a stack like this: (bottom) A B C (top)  \n",
    "then it reads the first '-mul', which is the multiply operation and requires 2 inputs, so it will pick the image on the top (C) and then the second image (B).  \n",
    "It will multiply them, creating the image (C * B) and put it back on the stack: (bottom) A (C * B) (top).  \n",
    "It will then read the second '-mul' and do the same, multiplying (C * B) with A.  \n",
    "Then it will put it back in the stack, see that there isnt more operation and that there is only 1 thing in the stack and output it.  \n",
    "If there is still more than 1 item in the stack at the end, it will give an error.  \n",
    "If there is not enough object in the stack for a specific operation (like '-mul' with only 1 object) it will also give and error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

      "     compute summary statistics across images or along image axes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     This command uses a stack-based syntax, with operators (specified using\n",
      "     options) operating on the top-most entries (i.e. images or values) in the\n",
      "     stack. Operands (values or images) are pushed onto the stack in the order\n",
      "     they appear (as arguments) on the command-line, and operators (specified\n",

      "\n",
      "     As an additional feature, this command will allow images with different\n",

      "     conditions: for each axis, the dimensions match if they are the same size,\n",
      "     or one of them has size one. In the latter case, the entire image will be\n",

      "     N copies of the 3D image along the 4th axis (the missing dimension is\n",

    "- Therefore, the maximas of the dODF should match bundle orienation.  \n",
    "- However, there is still some diffusion in other orientations.  \n",
