    "#### Basics of image registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is 3 broad \"types\" of registration (sometimes refered to as degrees-of-freedom (dof)):  \n",
    "- **Rigid**: only translations and rotation, data is a \"rigid\" 3D block that gets moved around, (6 dof)  \n",
    "- **Affine**: same as Rigid + uniform stretching, squeezing and shearing (sometimes called linear, 12 dof)  \n",
    "- **\"Nonlinear\"**: Everything else, typically involving complex local deformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of non-linear registration with ANTs, we first apply a rigid registration to match the images centers and orientation, then an affine registration to match the \"scale/size\" of the image and finally, a SyN registration, which is a specific nonlinear deformation algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving image**: This is the image that your are registering **TO** something, the one that gets deformed.  \n",
    "**Fixed image**: This is the image that serves as target.  \n",
    "**Warped image**: This is the result of the registration. Its a modified version of the moving image **IN** the space of the fixed image.  \n",
    "**invWarped image**: You can also compute the opposite, i.e. a modified version of the fixed image in the moving space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only practical if you have a nice symmetric type of nonlinear registration, one where you can apply the inverse transform. SyN is one such \"well behave\" method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the Warped image will also have the resolution of the fixed space.  \n",
    "And the invWarped image will have the resolution of the moving space.  \n",
    "For this reason, it is common to register the lower resolution image **TO** the higher resolution one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One important **exception** is when we have some anatomical image like a T1 and some diffusion data. In that case, you register the anatomical image to the diffusion space. This is because you cannot apply nonlinear registration to diffusion data without messing up the relation between the images and diffusion b-vectors and you therefore **HAVE** to stay in diffusion native space until you are done with your diffusion local modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, in our case here, the moving image is the subject's FA, the fixed image is the MNI template. Therefore, the warped image is our subject warped in MNI space and the invWarped is a deformed template in subject space. "
