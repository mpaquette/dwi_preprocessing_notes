    "### Tractography\n",
    "\n",
    "Tractography is the process of building paths from the diffusion information.  \n",
    "In essence, it follows the orientation of the FOD to build \"streamlines\" (list of linked 3D points).  \n",
    "In pratice, there are many parameters to tractography, which we can roughly describe as:  \n",
    "- Where to start the streamline (**seeding**)  \n",
    "- How to pick a new orientation to follow from some point in the brain (**model**)    \n",
    "- When to stop (**masks**)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seeding\n",
    "Streamlines start from \"seed\", i.e. points in the brain.  \n",
    "- WM seeding: Seeding from everywhere inside a white matter mask  \n",
    "- interface seeding: Seeding from some WM-GM interface mask, or simply seeding from the GM (dilated a bit into WM)\n",
    "- ROI seeding: Seeding from some specific mask, typically a ROI  \n",
    "Once a type of seeding is decided, you need to define how much seed you will start.  \n",
    "- Option 1: A fixed number of seeds per voxel in the seeding mask (careful, this grows quickly in size)  \n",
    "- Option 2: A fixed number of total seed randomely selected in the seeding mask  \n",
    "- Option 3: A flexible number of radom seed for a fixed number of streamlines  \n",
    "Not all seeds will become valid streamlines (most won't actually, and it's very region dependant).  \n",
    "You can set a required number of streamlines instead of a numbers of seed. The tool will launch new random seed until finished.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stepping\n",
    "In tractography, you take steps following some local orientations.  \n",
    "The most common case if to take steps of fixed length, i.e. 0.1 mm  \n",
    "To properly capture the geometry, we want the step size to be smaller than the voxel size.  \n",
    "How much small will depend on the tractography method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Curvature\n",
    "Typically, you want to limit the curvature at each step, i.e. limit how sharp of a turn the streamline can take  \n",
    "This parameter will be dependant on the step size, for example, if you have step size of 0.1mm and maximum curvature per step of 9 degrees, the maximum curvature after 1mm (10 steps) will be 90 degrees. So, if you desire a similar limitation in a tractography with 0.5mm steps, you would pick 45 degrees maximum curvature.  \n",
    "You can think of the maximum curvature as the radius of the cone restricting the possible next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deterministic vs Probabilistic\n",
    "Det and Prob are two different approach to direction picking in tractography.  \n",
    "- DET: follows the maximum peaks of the FOD (within the \"cone\" of the maximum curvature)  \n",
    "- PROB: Pick a random direction within the cone with the size of the FOD weigthing the probability of each direction  \n",
    "For a given seed, DET will always produce the same streamline, while PROB will vary, hence their names.  \n",
    "DET gives cleaner looking tracks but typically smaller in reach because it struggle in crossing and fanning area.  \n",
    "PROB gives much messier looking tracts and as more \"false tracts\", but it is a more accurate representation of the possible paths. You can think of it as exploring the uncertainty of the data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Connectomics is typically done with probabilistic tractography, but you will porbably prefer deterministic for paper figures ;)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "There a many different masks involve in tractography, depending what you want to do, how's your seeding, what are the ROIs.  \n",
    "- Mask from FOD computation: This mask isn't explicitely used but you can't have streamlines begining or propagating in voxels without any directional information.   \n",
    "- Seeding mask: Mask specifying where streamlines can start.  \n",
    "- Tracking mask: Mask specifying where the streamline can propagate. If a next step brings you outside this mask, the propagation of the streamline stops. What happens next depend on tracking options (keep or reject streamline)  \n",
    "- Target mask: Mask specifying region(s) that streamlines NEED to cross to be valid. What happens next depend on tracking options (stop or continue at target)  \n",
    "- Exclusion mask: Mask specifying region(s) that streamlines CANNOT cross to be valid. Reject streamline crossing them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to carefully design the masks of tractography.  \n",
    "For example, if you have a thin WM region and the mask is too \"small\" / \"tight\", streamlines could exit the tracking mask even when they are roughly following the desired direction.  \n",
    "Alternatively, if the mask is too \"large\" / \"dilated\", streamline might wander to regions where the FOD are misestimated because if outside WM.  \n",
