    "#### Why does this happen?\n",
    "random thermal fluctuation in the sensor.\n",
    "#### What if we ignore it?\n",
    "Noise makes regions less homogenous than they should be and leads to bias in model estimation.  \n",
    "#### Why correct it now?\n",
    "Correcting noise depend on having some prior knowledge of its mathematical form. For instance, any steps that involve registration (like motion correction or distorsion correction) will involve some amount of interpolation which will destroy our priors on the noise.  \n",
    "#### correction tool: dwidenoise\n",
    "dwidenoise is the MRtrix denoising (for dwi, it requires a 4th dimension of 30+ images).  \n",
    "It is very convenient because it doesnt require to estimate the level of noise before, doesnt require masking and it doesnt blur the image.  \n",
    "It is a PCA thresholding type of denoising (more later).  \n",
    "In a nutshell, it takes small 5x5x5 blocks in space across all bvecs and exploit similarity + known properties of random noise.  \n",
    "There are no relevant flags to change, default parameter are good. I am only using the -noise flag to output the estimated noise levels (standard deviations of a normal distribution in each 5x5x5 block)  \n",
    "If you have a very large number of diffusion directions, you might need to use a bigger windows like 7x7x7 by adding the flag '-extent 7'. This is because you need more voxel in your windows than the amount of image you have in the 4th dimension. So for instance the default 5x5x5 kernel has 5^3 = 125 voxels, so its enough for the the 70 volumes we have.  \n",
    "#### Quality control\n",
    "- When looking at the noise that was removed, there should not be obvious anatomical structure apart from ventricule and outline of the brain/skull.  \n",
    "- When looking at the map of sigma noise level, its should be relatively smooth with higher values in the center.  \n",

It works one slice at the time and it is IMPORTANT to specify which axes of the image where the true slice orientation from the acquisition. Since gibbs ringing is a very specific acquisition related artefact, It will NOT work in the wrong orientation. The slice encoding orientation is encoded in the DICOM header, when we ran \"mrinfo\" on the DICOM previously, it showed \"SliceEncodingDirection: k\" in the extra information, this mean that the slice encoding direction is the 3rd axe (it goes (i, j, k)), therefore we will run the tool on every (i, j) 2D slice.  \n",
